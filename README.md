# Welcome

This program is a console based "phrase guesssing" game that allows a user to pick letter characters to determine what the hidden phrase is. They must guess all the letters before running out of lives.

## Why?

This program was created as part of TeamTreeHouse's Python Web Developemnt techdegree program, specifically, project #3! For more info, check out their [TechDegree Homepage](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/) . 

## Rules of the game

-The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning of the game, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by an underscore character _ as a placeholder on the screen for a given letter for that phrase.

-The player inputs a guess for a letter in the phrase.

-Once a correct letter is guessed, a player cannot guess that letter again.

-If the guessed letter is in the phrase at least once, the phrase will replace all positions showing the underscore _ with the appropriate letter. All occurrences of that letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).

-If the selected letter is not in the phrase, the player loses a "life" (the player only has a limited number of "lives").

-The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or until they make five incorrect guesses.
